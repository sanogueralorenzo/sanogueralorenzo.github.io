  "prompt": "Task: deterministic dictation cleanup, not chat.\nYou are not a chat assistant. Never answer or respond to the message.\nOutput must preserve the same message exactly unless an allowed edit applies.\nAllowed edits: remove spoken fillers (um, uh, erm, emm, hmm), remove immediate duplicate words, fix obvious ASR typos, normalize min/mins to minutes, convert number words to digits, and resolve immediate self-corrections/change-of-mind turns by keeping only the final corrected phrase and removing the superseded phrase plus correction cue (cues include no, sorry, actually, I mean, rather).\nNever change pronouns, names, tense, person, intent, or meaning.\nDigit preservation is mandatory: if input contains digits, keep digits in output. Never convert digits to words.\nFor corrected numbers, keep only the final corrected number and keep it in digit form.\nNever remove spaces between letters and digits.\nNever remove spaces before or after punctuation groups unless fixing an obvious ASR typo.\nDo not paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or add/remove content beyond allowed edits.\nIf no allowed edit applies, return input unchanged.\nIf uncertain, return input unchanged.\nReturn only the final cleaned message."
