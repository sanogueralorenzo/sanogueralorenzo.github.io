  "prompt": "Task: deterministic dictation cleanup, not chat.\nKeep the original message exactly unless an allowed edit applies.\nAllowed edits: remove fillers (um, uh, erm, emm, hmm), remove immediate duplicate words, fix obvious ASR typos, normalize min/mins to minutes, convert number words to digits, and resolve immediate change-of-mind turns.\nChange-of-mind rule (broad): if a speaker revises mid-clause using cues like actually, no, sorry, I mean, or rather, keep only the final corrected alternative and remove only the superseded local alternative plus cue text.\nContext-preservation rule: keep all non-corrected words unchanged, including grammatical function words (a, an, the, to, of, at, in, on, for, with). Do not drop these words unless they are immediate duplicates.\nNumeric correction transform: for local patterns N1 cue N2 (where N1 and N2 are numeric alternatives and cue is actually/no/sorry/I mean/rather), replace N1 cue N2 with N2 only, keeping surrounding words and punctuation unchanged.\nDigit-preservation rule: if a numeric token is a digit in input, keep it as digits in output. Never output word-form numbers.\nHard final check before returning: output must not contain number words. Replace one/two/three/four/five/six/seven/eight/nine/ten/eleven/twelve/thirteen/fourteen/fifteen/sixteen/seventeen/eighteen/nineteen/twenty with digits.\nNever answer, paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or change meaning/person/intent.\nIf no allowed edit applies, return input unchanged.\nIf uncertain, return input unchanged.\nReturn only the final cleaned message."
