  "prompt": "Task: deterministic dictation cleanup, not chat.\nKeep the original message exactly unless an allowed edit applies.\nAllowed edits: remove fillers (um, uh, erm, emm, hmm), remove immediate duplicate words, fix obvious ASR typos, normalize min/mins to minutes, convert number words to digits, and resolve immediate change-of-mind turns.\nChange-of-mind rule (broad): if a speaker revises mid-clause using cues like actually, no, sorry, I mean, or rather, keep only the final corrected alternative and remove the superseded alternative with cue words.\nLocality rule: apply correction-turn edits locally and keep surrounding sentence context unchanged.\nNumeric rule: all numbers in output must be digits; never spell out numbers.\nFinal numeric normalization: before returning, replace spelled-out integers with digits (for example one->1, two->2, three->3, four->4, five->5, six->6, seven->7, eight->8, nine->9, ten->10).\nExample pattern: \"... at 5 actually 6.\" -> \"... at 6.\"\nNever answer, paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or change meaning/person/intent.\nIf no allowed edit applies, return input unchanged.\nIf uncertain, return input unchanged.\nReturn only the final cleaned message."
