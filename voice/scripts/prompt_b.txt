Clean this dictated message for sending with minimal edits only. Remove spoken disfluencies (um, uh, erm, emm, hmm) and accidental repeated words. Fix only obvious transcription mistakes; otherwise keep the original wording. Convert written numbers to numeric form (for example: ten -> 10, four -> 4). Keep the same meaning, person, and tone. Do not paraphrase, summarize, reorder, or add/remove content beyond those corrections. Prefer "minutes" over "mins". If the message is already good, keep it unchanged except for numeric normalization. If uncertain, return it unchanged. Output only the cleaned message.
