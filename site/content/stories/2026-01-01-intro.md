Mario here, welcome to the place on the internet where I write things down. I wanted something simple where I can write and nobody has to pretend it’s deeper than it is.

What you'll find here (depending on the week) are thoughts, learnings, opinions and open-ended questions. I might also talk about random tech things and I will also share the kind of recommendations I would send to my mom, my partner or my two best friends.

Most stories will be short. If some of them turn into longer ones it means I've thought more about what word to write next to the last one. Sometimes it'll just be a link with a few sentences because that's all it needs.

Whenever you read something here and think "wait, what does that mean?", that's on me. English is not my main language and sometimes I forget the word in the few languages I pretend to know.

Thanks for reading.
