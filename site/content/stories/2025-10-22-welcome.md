title: "The New Blog: Honest Stories"
summary: "A quick intro on choosing Hugo for this site and stories you can expect (people, tech, recommendations and other thoughts)."

Hello there, and thanks for stopping by. After tinkering with a few static site generators, I decided to start this space with Hugo. I wanted a setup that would let me focus on writing instead of wrestling with build steps, and Hugo hit the sweet spot: Markdown in, fast builds out, and all the flexibility I need to make it work for me.

The simplicity was a big selling point. Hugo's instant previews mean I can experiment quickly, and its templating system gives me enough control to iterate when I want to pretend to be a designer. It also behaves nicely with Git, which makes publishing feel like any other commit. In short, the workflow makes sense for how I like to build things.

As for what you can expect here, the plan is to keep it honest where I will cover topics ranging from people, tech recommendations and other thoughts, and grounded in things I actually use. I'll dig into the tech I'm learning or shipping, share recommendations that earn a spot in my routine, shine a light on people whose work inspires me, and capture the loose thoughts that tend to surface when those threads intersect with day-to-day life. Some posts will be practical, others more reflective, but all of them will be honest.

I'm excited to see where this goes. If any of this sounds interesting, stick aroundâ€”there's plenty more to write.
